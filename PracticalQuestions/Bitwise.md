# Bitwise Quseions

These questions basically test your knowledge/ability on bitwise operations, we should now them but from time to time you need a refresh.

## Changes to binary string when you:

Adding Numbers:
When adding two integers in binary, its the same as you would with decimal numbers except you performs the same operation with binary.

    1011    (11)
   +1101    (13)
   ------------
   11000    (24)

Just like decimal addition we carry the 1 to the next value.

Subtracting Numbers:
Subtracting numbers is almost identical to decimal subtraction

    1101    (13)
    -101    (5)
    ----
   10000    (8)

Dividing Numbers:

Multiplying Numbers:
Multiplying numbers is also pretty similar, where you need to move by each character and move across.

              1011    (11)
              x110    (6)
              ----  
 0 x 1011     0000
 1 x 1011    10110
 1 x 1011   101100        
        ------------------
           1000010     (66)
